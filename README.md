This repository contains solution of some challenging data science problems

1.  Geo Clustering problem details are here:

                  Identify commercial centres using Points of Interest (POI) data

                  Aim: 

                  There's a lot of open data available about the demographics and geography of the planet. But this information is not necessarily supervised in any particular structure from which insights can be drawn.

                  This task requires you to create clusters of distinct commercial centres or markets using points of interest data of a city (the city could be yours). Points of interest (POI) data provides location information of different places or POIs along with their defining tags like school, type of outlets, type of building, etc.

                  Objective:

                  Get Points of Interest from open data sources like open street map (OSM).
                  Understand how spatial location data works
                  Understand spatial vector data types and how to manipulate it using your language of choice.
                  Understand necessary GIS concepts like projections, spatial clustering, etc.
                  Figure out a way of clustering these points into commercial centres/markets.
                  Categorise or rank the resultant commercial centres/markets by their expected footfall/ambient population. (Hint: Absolute number of footfall/ambient population is not required) 
                  Visualise the resultant commercial centres/markets. 

                  Data Source:

                  POI (OSM) data- https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=11/28.6518/77.2219
                  You can use overpy (a python frontend for overpass API of OSM) to get OSM data for the desired city.
                  (Tip: you can use overpass-turbo to frame queries)
